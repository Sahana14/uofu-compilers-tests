;;; This package provides a simple diff-like capability in Packet. This includes
;;; diffs of arbitrary lists or of text files. It also includes an implementation
;;; of the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm, which is the basis of the
;;; diff algorithm.

;;; This module requires the list-index function from SRFI 1: List Library.

(require (only-in srfi/1 list-index))

;;; Longest Common Subsequence

;;; The longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence that is
;;; common to a set of sequences. We are solving the special case with exactly
;;; two sequences, which are represented as lists. This is the basis of the diff
;;; algorithm.

;;; The recursive longest common subsequence algorithm is given below. However,
;;; it has time complexity approaching 2^n.

;;; (define (list-lcs list-1 list-2 (test equal?))
;;;   (cond ((null? list-1) '())
;;;         ((null? list-2) '())
;;;         ((test (car list-1) (car list-2))
;;;          (cons (car list-1) (list-lcs (cdr list-1) (cdr list-2) test)))
;;;         (else
;;;          (let ((lcs-1 (list-lcs list-1 (cdr list-2) test))
;;;                (lcs-2 (list-lcs (cdr list-1) list-2 test)))
;;;            (if (> (length lcs-1) (length lcs-2))
;;;                lcs-1
;;;                lcs-2)))))

;;; The problem with the naive recursive solution is that the same subproblems
;;; are solved many different times. The solution is to use dynamic programming
;;; to check to see if we've solved a subproblem before. If we have, we use the
;;; previously computed solution. If not, we compute and store the solution. This
;;; is done via memoization.

;;; We could use David Herman's memoize package on PLaneT. I tried it and it
;;; works fine, but there are two issues that made me revert to 'rolling my own'
;;; memoization in this case.
;;;  1) The tests in Dave's PLaneT package pull in a lot of other packages and
;;;     many of them have not been converted to Racket. This results in many
;;;     error messages that I would rather not have users subjected to. [Although
;;;     they don't actually affect the memoization macros.]
;;;  2) In the case of the longest common subsequence algorithm, problem
;;;     instances are unique and we want a new cache for every problem instance.

;;; (list-lcs list-1 list-2 [test]) -> list?
;;;   list-1 : list?
;;;   list-2 : list?
;;;   test : (-> any/c any/c boolean?) = equal?
;;; Returns the longest common subsequence (LCS) of list-1 and list-2 using test
;;; to compare the elements. This is a memoized version of the recursive
;;; algorithm above. Note that the memoization cache is implemented as a two level
;;; index.
(define (list-lcs list-1 list-2 (test equal?))
  (let ((cache (make-hash)))
    (define (do-list-lcs list-1 list-2)
      (hash-ref!
       (hash-ref! cache list-1 (make-hash))
       list-2
       (lambda ()
         (cond ((null? list-1) '())
               ((null? list-2) '())
               ((test (car list-1) (car list-2))
                (cons (car list-1) (do-list-lcs (cdr list-1) (cdr list-2))))
               (else
                (let ((lcs-1 (do-list-lcs list-1 (cdr list-2)))
                      (lcs-2 (do-list-lcs (cdr list-1) list-2)))
                  (if (> (length lcs-1) (length lcs-2))
                      lcs-1
                      lcs-2)))))))
    (do-list-lcs list-1 list-2)))

;;; Example:

;;; (list-lcs '(a b c d f g h j q z) '(a b c d e f g i j k r x y z) eq?) =>
;;; (a b c d f g j z)

;;; Diff

;;; The diff algorithm computes the differences between two sequences in the form
;;; of what changes are required to the first sequence to produce the second
;;; sequence. This is based on the longest common subsequence.

;;; Once the longest common subsequence is computed (using list-lcs), it's easy
;;; to produce the diff-like output:
;;;   If an item is absent in the LCS but present in the first sequence, it must
;;;   have been deleted.
;;;   If an item is absent in the LCS but present in the second sequence, it must
;;;   have been added.

;;; (list-diff list-1 list-2 [test]) -> list?
;;;   list-1 : list?
;;;   list-2 : list?
;;;   test : (-> any/c any/c boolean?) = equal?
;;; Returns a list of the differences between list-1 and list-2 using test to
;;; compare the elements. Items common to both lists are incuded in the list as
;;; is. Items that have been added are included as a list whose first element is
;;; #:added followed by the added elements. Items that have been removed are
;;; included as a list whose first element is #:removed followed by the deleted
;;; elements.
(define (list-diff list-1 list-2 (test equal?))

             (sync-list-2 (list-index (lambda (x) (test x item)) list-2))
             (removed (take list-1 sync-list-1))
             (added (take list-2 sync-list-2)))

;;; Text File Diff

;;; A common use of diff is to print the differences between two text file -
;;; like the Unix diff command. The files are read as sequences of lines and
;;; list-diff is used to compute the differences between the files. The
;;; differences are then printed (and void returned). Lines common to both files
;;; are denoted by "=|", lines that are added are denoted by ">|", and lines that
;;; are removed are denoted by "<|".
;;;
;;; At some point it might me nice to change this to print in a format similar to
;;; the Unix diff command format.

;;; (ile-diff file-1 file-2) -> void?
;;;   file-1 : path-string?
;;;   file-2 : path-string?
;;; Prints the differences between file-1 and file-2.
